# -DL-Lab-4-Wrap-Up-Autonomous-Driving-Car-Detection
- Reviewed **CNN basics** and their role in object detection.   - Applied a **pretrained YOLOv8 model** to detect cars (and other objects) in road scenes.   - Learned to **draw bounding boxes** and filter by class.   - Experimented with **confidence and IoU thresholds**, seeing their effect on detections.   - Completed **Advanced Tasks**:
